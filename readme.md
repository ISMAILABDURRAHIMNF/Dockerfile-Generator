# Dockerfile Generator

Hi, thanks for visiting my repo, this project is a simple dockerfile generator based on OpenAI API, so make sure u already have an OpenAI API key. This Dockerfile Generator is accessed through in console, but this project will always be developed to bring more features.

## üîß How to use

Clone this repo to ur computer

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ISMAILABDURRAHIMNF/Dockerfile-Generator.git
```

Install all required modules using `pip install` on the console

```bash
  pip install reqirements.txt -r
```

Create the `.env` file in the same directory as `main.py` using this variable.

```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=PUT_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
```

Use the program by running `main.py`

```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=PUT_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
```

## ‚ùóWarning !

Make sure u already have an OpenAI API key and save it in the `.env` file.
